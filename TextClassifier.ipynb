boy: “My mom told me those who have marked wrists are angels.”  Girl: “I’m not an angel”  Little boy: “Of course you are! Mom said only angels hurt themselves because they don’t like the life on earth. The world is destroying them so they try to return to heaven again. They are too sensitive to pain of others and their own.”  Girl: “You know your mom is very wise.”  Little boy: “Thank you. She is also an angel, but she already returned home.”   \n",
